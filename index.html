<h1>Bailey Martin</h1>
<p> My name is Bailey Martin and I am a Freshman Exercise Science Major at BJU. <br>
 I play for the Bruins Women's Soccer Team, but I enjoy playing all kinds of sports.<br>
 I joined the Pi Delta Chi Classics, and I'm excited to see how I can get involved this year. <br>
I go to Suber Road Baptist Church, and I play oboe in the Orchestra. Sometimes I help with the children's church ministry. 
My favorite soft drink is pepsi and I love all things chocolate.
