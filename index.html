<h1 style="text-align:center;"> Bailey Martin</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;"> My name is Bailey Martin and I am a Freshman Exercise Science Major at BJU. <br>
 I play for the  Women's Soccer Team at BJU (<a href="bjubruins.com">BJU Bruins</a>), but I enjoy playing all kinds of sports.<br>
 I joined the Pi Delta Chi Classics, and I'm excited to see how I can get involved this year. <br>
I go to Suber Road Baptist Church (<a href="suberroad.org">SuberRoad</a>), and I play oboe in the Orchestra. Sometimes I help with the children's church ministry.<br> 
My favorite soft drink is pepsi and I love all things chocolate.
